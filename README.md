## Overview

`ssa-scRNA` is a Python package for semi-supervised cell type annotation of scRNA-seq data. The pipeline combines weak-labeling strategies (QCQ, Otsu, graph-based, Dirichlet Process) with supervised label propagation (KNN, Random Forest, Centroid) and consensus voting to assign cell type labels from marker genes.

### Intended Use

This package is designed for annotating scRNA-seq datasets when you have prior knowledge of marker genes for target cell types. It is not intended for unsupervised clustering or novel cell type discovery (yet!). Instead, it provides a robust framework for leveraging known biology to generate high-confidence annotations.

**Key characteristics:**
- Combines multiple weak labeling strategies for robust predictions
- Propagates labels from seed assignments to unlabeled cells
- Evaluates method agreement using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)
- Runs efficiently on standard hardware, taking advantage of parallel processing where possible

**Requirements and Limitations:**
- Requires prior knowledge of marker genes for target cell types
- Annotation accuracy depends directly on marker gene quality
- Limited to cell types with defined markers (no automated discovery)
- Works best with well-separated cell types in the data

## Installation

The package requires Python ≥ 3.10. Core dependencies (scanpy, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy) are automatically installed.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import scanpy as sc
import ssa_scrna as ssa

# Load your scRNA-seq data
adata = sc.read_h5ad("data/pbmc.h5ad")

# Define marker genes for cell types of interest
markers = {
    "CD8_T": ["CD8A", "CD8B", "GZMA"],
    "CD4_T": ["CD4", "IL7R", "TCF7"],
    "B_cells": ["CD19", "MS4A1", "CD79A"],
    "Dendritic": ["ITGAX", "CD1C", "FCER1A"],
    # ... more cell types
}

# Phase 1: Generate predictions from multiple strategies
strategies = {
    "seeds_qcq": ssa.strategies.QCQAdaptiveThresholding(markers=markers),
    "seeds_otsu": ssa.strategies.OtsuAdaptiveThresholding(markers=markers),
    "seeds_graph": ssa.strategies.GraphScorePropagation(markers=markers),
}
results = ssa.tl.label(adata, strategies=strategies, n_jobs=4)

# Combine Phase 1 predictions with consensus voting
consensus_seed = ssa.strategies.ConsensusVoting(
    keys=list(strategies.keys()),
    majority_fraction=0.66
)
ssa.tl.label(adata, strategies=consensus_seed, key_added="seeds_consensus")

# Phase 2: Propagate labels to unlabeled cells
propagators = {
    "prop_knn": ssa.strategies.KNNPropagation(seed_key="seeds_consensus"),
    "prop_rf": ssa.strategies.RandomForestPropagation(seed_key="seeds_consensus"),
}
ssa.tl.label(adata, strategies=propagators, n_jobs=2)

# Final consensus
final_consensus = ssa.strategies.ConsensusVoting(
    keys=list(propagators.keys()),
    majority_fraction=0.66
)
ssa.tl.label(adata, strategies=final_consensus, key_added="labels_final")

# Results are stored in adata.obs
print(adata.obs["labels_final"].value_counts())
```

### Working with Individual Strategies

```python
# Apply a single strategy
strategy = ssa.strategies.QCQAdaptiveThresholding(markers=markers, quota=50)
result = ssa.tl.label(adata, strategies=strategy, key_added="my_labels")

# Access the result
print(f"Assigned labels: {result['my_labels'].labels.value_counts()}")

# Check confidence scores if available
if "my_labels_max_confidence" in adata.obs:
    print(f"Mean confidence: {adata.obs['my_labels_max_confidence'].mean():.2f}")
```

### Batch Processing with Async

```python
import asyncio

async def label_multiple():
    strategies = [
        ssa.strategies.QCQAdaptiveThresholding(markers),
        ssa.strategies.OtsuAdaptiveThresholding(markers),
    ]
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        *[ssa.tl.label_async(adata, s) for s in strategies]
    )
    return results

# results = asyncio.run(label_multiple())
```


## Example: PBMC3k Dataset

A complete end-to-end pipeline is provided in `examples/pbmc3k/run.py`:

```bash
# Run the PBMC3k example
uv run ssa-examples pbmc3k
```

This demonstrates:
- QC filtering with data-driven thresholds
- Feature preprocessing (HVGs, PCA, neighbors)
- Phase 1 seeding with 4 strategies + consensus
- Phase 2 propagation with 3 ML algorithms
- Baseline clustering (Leiden at multiple resolutions)
- Visualization (UMAP, t-SNE)
- Quantitative ablation metrics (ARI, NMI)


## Architecture

### Strategy Pattern

All labeling methods inherit from `BaseLabelingStrategy` and implement:

```python
class MyStrategy(BaseLabelingStrategy):
    def __init__(self, markers, **kwargs):
        self.markers = markers
    
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "my_strategy"
    
    def execute_on(self, adata: AnnData) -> LabelingResult:
        # Implement labeling logic
        labels = self.predict(adata)
        
        return LabelingResult(
            adata=adata,
            strategy=self,
            labels=labels,
            obs={"confidence": confidence_scores},  # Optional
            uns={"parameters": self.__dict__},      # Optional
        )
```

## Implementation

### Phase 0: Marker Gene Specification

Define markers as a dictionary mapping cell type names to lists of genes:

```python
markers = {
    "T_cells": ["CD3D", "CD3E", "CD3G"],
    "B_cells": ["CD19", "MS4A1", "CD79A"],
    "Monocytes": ["LYZ", "S100A8", "S100A9"],
    "NK_cells": ["GNLY", "NKG7", "GZMB"],
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use 3-5 robust marker genes per cell type for reliability
- Prefer genes with high expression in target cell type
- Prefer genes with low expression in other cell types
- Test markers on reference data before large-scale analysis

### Phase 1: Initial Labeling

Use any (or many!, taking consensus) of the following strategies to generate seed labels:

| Strategy | Class | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| QCQ Adaptive Thresholding | `QCQAdaptiveThresholding` | Quantile-based marker scoring with data-driven thresholds |
| Otsu Adaptive Thresholding | `OtsuAdaptiveThresholding` | Automatic threshold selection via Otsu's method |
| Graph Score Propagation | `GraphScorePropagation` | Network-based marker co-expression scoring |
| Dirichlet Process Labeling | `DirichletProcessLabeling` | Probabilistic soft clustering with confidence scores |

**Common Parameters:**
- `markers` (dict): Cell type → marker gene list mapping
- `unknown_label` (str, default "unknown"): Label for unlabeled cells

### Phase 2: Label Propagation Strategies

Propagate seed labels to unlabeled cells using supervised learning:

| Strategy | Class | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| KNN Propagation | `KNNPropagation` | k-Nearest neighbor classification |
| Random Forest Propagation | `RandomForestPropagation` | Ensemble-based classification |
| Nearest Centroid Propagation | `NearestCentroidPropagation` | Centroid-based assignment |

**Common Parameters:**
- `seed_key` (str): Column in `adata.obs` containing seed labels
- `obsm_key` (str, default "X_pca"): Feature representation for classification
- `unknown_label` (str, default "unknown"): Label for unlabeled cells
- `keep_seeds` (bool, default True): Preserve original seed labels

### Consensus Strategy

Obtain a final consensus label by combining multiple strategies with majority voting:

| Strategy | Class | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Consensus Voting | `ConsensusVoting` | Combine multiple predictions via majority voting |

**Parameters:**
- `keys` (list[str]): Column names to combine
- `majority_fraction` (float, default 0.66): Fraction of votes required (0.51 to 1.0)
- `unknown_label` (str, default "unknown"): Label for unlabeled cells

**Example Usage:**
```python
# Combine 3 seed strategies
consensus = ssa.strategies.ConsensusVoting(
    keys=["seeds_qcq", "seeds_otsu", "seeds_graph"],
    majority_fraction=0.66  # Supermajority: 2 out of 3
)
ssa.tl.label(adata, strategies=consensus, key_added="seeds_consensus")
```

#### Using `majority_fraction` for Consensus Voting

Controls how many independent strategies must agree to assign a label:

- `0.51`: Simple majority (loose, more cells labeled)
- `0.66`: Supermajority (balanced, recommended)
- `1.00`: Unanimous (strict, fewer cells labeled, higher confidence)

**Example:**
```python
# Strict consensus (all methods must agree)
consensus = ssa.strategies.ConsensusVoting(
    keys=["seeds_qcq", "seeds_otsu", "seeds_graph"],
    majority_fraction=1.0
)

# Loose consensus (2 out of 3)
consensus = ssa.strategies.ConsensusVoting(
    keys=["seeds_qcq", "seeds_otsu", "seeds_graph"],
    majority_fraction=0.51
)
```


## Output Format

Labeling results are stored in `adata.obs` with the following convention:

```
├── {key}                         # Main labels ("Unknown" = unlabeled)
├── {key}_max_confidence          # Maximum voting score (if available)
├── {key}_is_confident            # Boolean confidence flag (optional)
└── {key}_params                  # Strategy parameters in adata.uns
```

Example output structure for Phase 1 seeding:
```
adata.obs columns:
├── seeds_qcq              # QCQ strategy labels
├── seeds_otsu             # Otsu strategy labels
├── seeds_graph            # Graph strategy labels
├── seeds_dpmm             # DPMM strategy labels
├── seeds_dpmm_max_confidence    # DPMM confidence score
├── seeds_dpmm_is_confident      # DPMM confidence boolean
└── seeds_consensus        # Consensus from majority voting
```

## Performance Considerations

- QCQ and Otsu strategies run in seconds to minutes depending on data size
- Graph-based methods may take longer due to network construction
- DPMM is computationally intensive; consider subsampling for large datasets. Parallel processing is available for DPMM using the `n_jobs` parameter.
- Multiple strategies can be run in parallel using `label_async` and `asyncio.gather` for efficient batch processing

## Troubleshooting

### "No labeled cells found in the seed column"
- Phase 2 propagation requires at least some seeds from Phase 1
- Check that Phase 1 resulted in labeled cells (not all "unknown")
- Try looser marker gene definitions or `majority_fraction=0.51`

### "Key 'X_pca' not found in adata.obsm"
- Ensure PCA was computed before running propagation strategies
- Run: `sc.tl.pca(adata)` and `sc.pp.neighbors(adata)`

### Few cells labeled in Phase 1
- Markers might be missing from your dataset
- Check gene names match annotation (case-sensitive)
- Markers might be too specific; try more permissive thresholds

### Inconsistent labels between methods
- This is expected! Different methods have different biases
- Use consensus voting to increase confidence
- Check `majority_fraction` parameter

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use gene expression data from different platforms (10x, Smart-seq)?**  
A: Yes! Ensure proper normalization before running (`sc.pp.normalize_total` + `sc.pp.log1p`)

**Q: What if I have confidence scores for true cell types?**  
A: Filter your labeled data to high-confidence cells before using as seed labels

**Q: Can I use this for novel cell type discovery?**  
A: Not at the moment. This package is designed for annotation with known markers, not unsupervised clustering. Future versions may include treating "unknown" cells as a separate cluster for discovery, using a hierarchical approach.

**Q: How many marker genes do I need?**  
A: 3-5 robust markers per cell type is a good starting point. More markers reduce false positives.

**Q: Can I combine predictions with a reference atlas?**  
A: Not built-in, but is possible using a custom strategy.
